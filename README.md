# dotfiles
Configuration files for stuff on Linux. The bootstrap script replaces local configuration files with symlinks to the ones in this repository, and puts the local versions in files like `~/.zshrc.local`. To set this up, run `$ ./bootstrap.sh`. This script should be run when new dotfiles are added, but otherwise updating the logfiles should amount to running `git pull` in the dotfiles repo. The bootstrap script also adds a daily cron job to pull the repo.
